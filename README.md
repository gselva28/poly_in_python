# Polymorphism and Abstraction in Python
Problem:-
Create Rectangle and Square classes. Rectangle should have two instance variables: self.width and self.length. Square should have one instance variable self.s1. Define a method for both classes called calculate_perimeter that calculates the perimeter of the shapes they represent and returns it. Then, create Rectangle and Square objects and call the method on both of them.
